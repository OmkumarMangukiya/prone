- ✅ Renders task management interface
- ✅ Integrates with existing project system
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality
- ✅ Follows established code patterns

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The task management system is **fully functional** and ready for use:

1. **Navigate to any project**: `/projects/[id]` to see the integrated task management
2. **Access cross-project tasks**: `/tasks` for a unified task dashboard
3. **Create tasks**: Use the "Add Task" button (with appropriate permissions)
4. **Manage tasks**: Edit, update status, assign users, set due dates
5. **Filter and search**: Use the comprehensive filtering system

## 🔄 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

2. **Task Dependencies**: Link related tasks
3. **Subtasks**: Break down complex tasks
4. **Comments**: Add discussion threads to tasks
5. **File Attachments**: Attach documents to tasks
6. **Time Tracking**: Integration with time tracking features
7. **Notifications**: Real-time task assignment notifications
8. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select task operations
9. **Custom Fields**: Project-specific task fields
10. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, custom field filters

The foundation is solid and these enhancements can be built incrementally on the existing architecture.
